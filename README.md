# React Background Remover

Standalone React app from the examples of [@imgly/background_remover](https://github.com/imgly/background-removal-js), modified to work outside the mono-repo by using the lib from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@imgly/background-removal).

Update: The static assets for the background removal are now served from `/public/static/model` as this improves load times.
