# React Background Remover

Standalone React app from the examples of [@imgly/background_remover](https://github.com/imgly/background-removal-js), modified to work outside the mono-repo by using the lib from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@imgly/background-removal).

Note: Currently, uses the models and webm assets from UNPKG, which is SLOW.

ToDo:
- Server assets locally to improve speed

## Setup
1. Install dependencies
`npm install`
2. Start dev server
`npm start`
